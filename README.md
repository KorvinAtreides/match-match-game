# Match-Match game

### _Pet project dedicated to the match-match game_
In this game, players must match pairs of identical pictures from memory.

The calculation of the final score takes into account the time spent, the number of incorrect comparisons and the complexity of the game. 
##### Important: incorrect comparison takes extra time for animation.
The best games by the number of points are included in the high score table.

To register, you must enter your first name and last name and email address. Player and score data is stored in _indexedDB_. 

The mechanics of adding a player's avatar has been implemented. The avatar is stored in _indexedDB_ in base64 format and displayed in the header and on the high scores page.

The app is acceptable on https://korvinatreides.github.io/match-match-game/.
